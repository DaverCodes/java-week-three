its deeply unfortunate that I dont know off hand how to change the root of my repo- hopefully I will discover how before its too late

This website had its easy and hard parts. I am very happy with my prompt readout and how it is visible through the console regarding seeing what the user chose as a number, and if they clicked ok or cancel to proceed through the process. I also belive the mathmatics are properly defined. But for whatever reason connecting the two has proven to be the most difficult part.
